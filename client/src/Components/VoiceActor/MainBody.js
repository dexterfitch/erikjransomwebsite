      <p className="display-6">Erik Ransom is an accomplished, enthusiastic and experienced actor, writer and recording artist and voice-over performer, who has worked extensively in theatre, film, television and video games.</p>
      <p className="lead">With a particular passion for character work in both the North American and European markets, Erik is able to work remotely from his frequently-upgraded home studio, and is happy to travel for sessions at established studios anywhere in the Greater New York City or Philadelphia metropolitan areas. As a BIPOC, queer artist, Erik is a proud member of both the PGM Voiceover List and the Queervox database, which highlight the voices of artists from underrepresented communities.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>From an early age Erik was mentored in Voice, Speech, Accents and Dialects by Jim DeMonic, former Head of Voice &amp; Speech at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. After receiving his B.A. in Vocal Performance from T.C.N.J., Erik went on to perform in countless plays, musicals and operas, before diving into on-camera acting and voiceover work. Currently, Erik can be seen playing opposite Orange is the New Black's Taryn Manning and Disney&rsquo;s Encanto's Diane Guerrero as one of the stars of Happy Yummy Chicken (PeacockTV) and recurring as Fran&ccedil;ois on the Emmy-nominated series Tainted Dreams (Amazon Prime). He narrates and portrays multiple supporting roles in the musical adventure audio series The World to Come, featuring Adrienne Barbeau (A 2021 Webby Award honoree).
